# AI_Integration
AI Integration Project for PAP Portfolio. This is a straightforward program that routes user prompts to the APIs of OpenAI and Gemini and returns their responses. I've attached sample prompts, including tips for the first day on the job and the best languages for backend development. 

Some of my takeaways of the two prompts is that OpenAI lists items one by one. Gemini on the other hand breaks down items into their own components and go into further detail for each component (e.g. what to do before, during, and after the first day on the job).
